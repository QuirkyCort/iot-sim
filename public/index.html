  <h1>Internet-of-Things Simulator (Blynk)</h1>

  <p>
    This site provides Internet-of-Things (IoT) simulators for use with the Legacy Blynk application.
    The simulator is only compatible with the Legacy Blynk app and not the new Blynk app.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The simulators are divided into "Blynk Server" and "Custom Server".
  </p>

  <h3>Blynk Server</h3>
  <p>
    If you are using the default Blynk server (...hosted by the creator of Blynk), use these simulators.
    As Blynk no longer provides registration of accounts for the legacy app, you can only use this if you already have an existing account with Blynk legacy.
  </p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Custom Server</h3>
  <p>
    These simulators are designed to work with custom Blynk servers hosted by A Posteriori, and will not work with a normal Blynk account.
    Due to resource limitations, we only provide accounts on the custom server to our students.
    If you are not one of our students and wish to use these simulators, please host your own copy (...<a href="https://github.com/QuirkyCort/iot-sim">code is on Github</a>) and run your own Blynk server.
